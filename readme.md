## Components
1. Nginx 1.25
2. PHP 8.3 fpm
3. MySQL 8
4. Laravel 10
5. Mailpit (only for debug emails on dev environment)

## Setting up Docker and docker-compose
1.For installing Docker please follow steps mentioned on page [install on Ubuntu linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) or [install on Mac/Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2.For installing docker-compose as `Linux Standalone binary` please follow steps on the page [install compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/) if you are using Linux OS.

Note 1: Please run next cmd after above step 2 if you are using Linux OS: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

Note 2: If you are using Docker Desktop for MacOS 12.2 or later - please enable [virtiofs](https://www.docker.com/blog/speed-boost-achievement-unlocked-on-docker-desktop-4-6-for-mac/) for performance (enabled by default since Docker Desktop v4.22).

## Setting up DEV environment
1.You can clone this repository from GitHub or install via composer.

Note: Delete `storage/mysql-data` folder if it is exists.

If you have installed composer and want to install environment via composer you can use next cmd command:
```bash
composer create-project systemsdk/docker-nginx-php-laravel example-app
```

2.Add domain to local `hosts` file:
```bash
127.0.0.1    localhost
```

3.Configure `/docker/dev/xdebug-main.ini` (Linux/Windows) or `/docker/dev/xdebug-osx.ini` (MacOS) (optional):

- In case you need debug only requests with IDE KEY: PHPSTORM from frontend in your browser:
```bash
xdebug.start_with_request = no
```
Install locally in Firefox extension "Xdebug helper" and set in settings IDE KEY: PHPSTORM

- In case you need debug any request to an api (by default):
```bash
xdebug.start_with_request = yes
```

4.Build, start and install the docker images from your terminal:
```bash
make build
make start
make composer-install
make env-dev
```
Note: If you want to change default docker configurations (web_port, etc...) - open `.env` file, edit necessary environment variable value and stop, rebuild, start docker containers.

5.Make sure that you have installed migrations/seeds:
```bash
make migrate
make seed
```

6.Set key for application:
```bash
make key-generate
```

7.In order to use this application, please open in your browser next urls:
- [http://localhost](http://localhost)
- [http://localhost:8025 (Mailpit)](http://localhost:8025)

## Setting up STAGING environment locally
1.You can clone this repository from GitHub or install via composer.

Note: Delete `storage/mysql-data` and `vendor` folder if it is exists.

If you have installed composer and want to install environment via composer you can use next cmd command:
```bash
composer create-project systemsdk/docker-nginx-php-laravel example-app
```
Note: If you want to change default docker configurations (web_port, etc...) - create uncommitted `.env` file, copy data from `.env.staging`, edit necessary environment variable value.

2.Build, start and install the docker images from your terminal:
```bash
make build-staging
make start-staging
```

3.Make sure that you have installed migrations:
```bash
make migrate-no-test
```

4.Set key for application:
```bash
make key-generate
```

## Setting up PROD environment locally

3.Edit `env.prod` and set necessary user/password for MySQL.

Note: If you want to change default docker configurations (web_port, etc...) - create uncommitted `.env` file, copy data from `.env.prod`, edit necessary environment variable value.

4.Build, start and install the docker images from your terminal:
```bash
make build-prod
make start-prod
```

5.Make sure that you have installed migrations:
```bash
make migrate-no-test
```

6.Set key for application:

## Getting shell to container
After application will start (`make start`) and in order to get shell access inside laravel container you can run following command:
```bash
make ssh
```
Note 1: Please use next make commands in order to enter in other containers: `make ssh-nginx`, `make ssh-supervisord`, `make ssh-mysql`.

Note 2: Please use `exit` command in order to return from container's shell to local shell.

## Building containers
In case you edited Dockerfile or other environment configuration you'll need to build containers again using next commands:
```bash
make down
make build
make start
```
Note: Please use environment-specific commands if you need to build test/staging/prod environment, more details can be found using help `make help`.

## Start and stop environment containers
Please use next make commands in order to start and stop environment:
```bash
make start
make stop
```
Note 1: For staging environment need to be used next make commands: `make start-staging`, `make stop-staging`.

## Working on your project
1. For new feature development, fork `develop` branch into a new branch with one of the two patterns:
    * `feature/{ticketNo}`
2. Commit often, and write descriptive commit messages, so its easier to follow steps taken when reviewing.
3. Push this branch to the repo and create pull request into `develop` to get feedback, with the format `feature/{ticketNo}` - "Short descriptive title of Jira task".
4. Iterate as needed.
5. Make sure that "All checks have passed" on CircleCI(or another one in case you are not using CircleCI) and status is green.
6. When PR is approved, it will be squashed & merged, into `develop` and later merged into `release/{No}` for deployment.

Note: You can find git flow detail example [here](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet).
